= Prerequisites for importing a virtual machine

Importing a virtual machine from Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) into {VirtProductName} has the following prerequisites:

* You must have admin user privileges.
* Storage:
** The {VirtProductName} local and shared persistent storage classes must support VM import.
** If you are using Ceph RBD block-mode volumes and the available storage space is too small for the virtual disk, the import process bar stops at 75% for more than 20 minutes and the migration does not succeed. No error message is displayed in the web console. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1910019[*BZ#1910019*]

* Networks:
** The RHV and {VirtProductName} networks must either have the same name or be mapped to each other.
** The RHV VM network interface must be `e1000`, `rtl8139`, or `virtio`.

* VM disks:
** The disk interface must be `sata`, `virtio_scsi`, or `virtio`.
** The disk must not be configured as a direct LUN.
** The disk status must not be `illegal` or `locked`.
** The storage type must be `image`.
** SCSI reservation must be disabled.
** `ScsiGenericIO` must be disabled.

* VM configuration:
** If the VM uses GPU resources, the nodes providing the GPUs must be configured.
** The VM must not be configured for vGPU resources.
** The VM must not have snapshots with disks in an `illegal` state.
** The VM must not have been created with {product-title} and subsequently added to RHV.
** The VM must not be configured for USB devices.
** The watchdog model must not be `diag288`.
